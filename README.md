# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code. A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#References)

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

This is an example of a loop in python.
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```
> This is a simple example.

- When you can you should apply syntax highlighting.

## Step 2 - Complete tasks
- [X] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
This is how to add tasks[^1]

## Step 3 - Use Emojis (Optional)
Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes. Here are some examples:
|Name|Shortcode|Emoji|
|-|-|-|
|Cloud|`:cloud:`|☁️|
|Cloud with lightning|`:cloud_with_lightning:`|🌩️|
|Cloud with snow|`:cloud_with_snow:`|🌨️|

```md
|Name|Shortcode|Emoji|
|-|-|-|
|Cloud|`:cloud`|☁️|
|Cloud with lightning|`:cloud_with_lightning`|🌩️|
|Cloud with snow|`:cloud_with_snow`|🌨️|
```
> This is what the code looks like in markdown.
